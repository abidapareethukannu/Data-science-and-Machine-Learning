# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Google Colab notebooks created to learn and implement core concepts in Data Science and Machine Learning. 
Each notebook focuses on a different algorithm or topic, demonstrating data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Included Notebooks
1. *LinearRegression.ipynb* – Simple linear regression example for supervised learning.
2. *Decision Tree.ipynb* – Classification using Decision Tree with visualization.
3. *KMeans.ipynb* – Unsupervised clustering using the K-Means algorithm.
4. *TensorFlow.ipynb* – Basic deep learning model built with TensorFlow.
5. *CNN.ipynb* – Convolutional Neural Network for image classification tasks.
6. *NB.ipynb* – Naive Bayes classifier for probabilistic learning and text classification.
7. *NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING.ipynb* – Text preprocessing and sentiment analysis using NLP techniques.
8. *Car.ipynb* – Car dataset analysis and prediction using regression models.
9. *Aptitude.ipynb* – Data handling and prediction using aptitude-based datasets.
10. *Untitled Notebooks* – Experimental or test notebooks created during exploration.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- *Python 3.x*
- *Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook*
- *NumPy*
- *Pandas*
- *Matplotlib*
- *Seaborn*
- *Scikit-learn*
- *TensorFlow / Keras*
- *NLTK / TextBlob*

## How to Use
1. Upload the notebooks to *Google Colab* or open them locally in *Jupyter Notebook*.
2. Install the necessary libraries:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow nltk
3. Run the cells in order to train and evaluate the models.
4. Modify datasets or parameters for your own experiments.

## Output and Results
Each notebook produces:
- Model accuracy and evaluation results.
- Data visualizations such as graphs and plots.
- Predictions or clustering results depending on the model.

## Purpose
These notebooks are created purely for educational and practical learning of Data Science and Machine Learning algorithms.

## License
